# Hey Djoe !

Instant communication system all-in-one destined to be integrated on any web page.

## Functionnalities:
* Text chat between two or multiple users
* Collaborative editing between multiple users
* Videoconference between two or multiple users
* Screen sharing from one to another user, or to multiple users

## Integration code

You can integrate it in your own web page by adding:

```

  <!-- XMPP client dependencies -->

  <link href="bower_components/jquery-ui/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  <script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/jquery-ui/jquery-ui.js"></script>

  <!-- end XMPP client dependencies -->

  <!-- XMPP client -->

  <link href="jsxc/build/css/jsxc.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  <script src="jsxc/build/lib/jsxc.dep.js"></script>
  <script src="jsxc/build/jsxc.js"></script>
  <script src="jsxc/build/jsxc_init.js"></script>

  <!-- end XMPP client -->
  
```
 
## Lot of servers to install but ... 

You can launch (almost)all with a few commands thanks to GNU/Linux and Docker:

```

    # /!\ Need Docker, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/remipassmoilesel/djoe-docker
    $ cd djoe-docker
    $ ./build-and-launch.sh

```

This produce an *example* installation with:

* Apache HTTP with a simple TLS configuration
* XMPP server
* Etherpad 
* Postgres database
* Statistics server

Need an external TURN server, credentials can be modified in Docker image configuration.

##Â Thanks to:

* [JSXC](https://www.jsxc.org/): An XMPP client, improved to correspond to the wole system
* [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/): A free XMPP server
* [RFC-5766 TURN Server](https://github.com/coturn/rfc5766-turn-server): A free server to handle media streams
* [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/): A collaborative editing solution
* [webrtc-experiment.com](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/)

Nothing would have been possible without these incredible projects !
And of course so many more: GNU/Linux Ubuntu, Apache HTTP, Postgres, ...
